https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

**Here are the steps to run the R script:**

1. Assuming your working directory to be **C:/cleandata**
2. Unzip the above file inside **C:/cleandata** so that it has **UCI HAR Dataset** folder after unzipping
3. Your **[run_analysis.R](../../run_analysis.R)** file should be directly under **C:/cleandata** too
4. Open RStudio and after setting the working directory to **C:/cleandata**, execute **source('run_analysis.R')**
5. **[tidy.txt](../../tidy.txt)** would be created under **C:/cleandata/UCI HAR Dataset** on successful execution
